Performance work:

* Use the GPU name to configure the NISOptimizer accordingly (depends on refactor)
* Add a switch to toggle half-precision floats (depends on refactor)
* Implement fixed foveated scaling (depends on refactor)

Feature work:

* Refactor to absorb the NIS SDK so we can control the shader more precisely
* Implement support for Direct3D 12 using D3D11on12
* Add brightness/contrast/saturation to the shader
* Integrate CptLucky8 exposure change
* Investigate (again) the FOV modifier idea (discussed on MSFS forum)
* Implement native support for Direct3D 12(?)

Compliance work (does not affect MSFS2020 as of Dec'21):

* Do not alter the application's xrEndFrameInfo(!)
* Test with image arraySize=2 (VPRT)
* Test with image sampeleCount>1 (MSAA)
* Handle depth submission (will be soon needed for MSFS2020)
* Handle imageRect that don't cover the full texure
