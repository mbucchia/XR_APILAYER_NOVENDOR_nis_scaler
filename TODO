Performance work:

* Update to NIS SDK 1.0.1
* Retrieve the GPU name to configure the NISOptimizer accordingly
* Optimize the vertex shader to only draw one triangle and use clipping
* Add a switch to toggle half-precision floats
* Implement fixed foveated scaling

Feature work:

* Implement support for Direct3D 12 using D3D11on12
* Add brightness/contrast/saturation to the shader
* Integrate CptLucky8 exposure change
* Investigate (again) the FOV modifier idea (discussed on MSFS forum)
* Implement native support for Direct3D 12(?)

Compliance work (does not affect MSFS2020 as of Dec'21):

* Do not alter the application's xrEndFrameInfo(!)
* Test with image arraySize=2 (VPRT)
* Test with image sampeleCount>1 (MSAA)
* Handle depth submission
* Handle imageRect that don't cover the full texure
