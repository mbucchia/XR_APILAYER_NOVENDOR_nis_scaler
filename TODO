Improvements:

* Investigate issue with dark scenes (reported on MSFS forum)
* Print runtime ID string in the log for debugging

Performance work:

* Use NVSharpen when scaling=1
* Investigate how to remove the color space conversion when using SteamVR
** If not: optimize the vertex shader to only draw one triangle and use clipping
* Add a switch to toggle half-precision floats
* Add an option to disable the bilinear scaler and save up memory

Compliance work:

* Do not alter the application's xrEndFrameInfo(!)
* Test with image arraySize=2 (VPRT)
* Test with image sampeleCount>1 (MSAA)
* Handle depth submission
* Handle imageRect that don't cover the full texure

Feature work:

* Implement support for Direct3D 12 using D3D11on12
* Investigate (again) the FOV modifier idea (discussed on MSFS forum)
* Implement preset hotkeys(?)
* Implement an overlay UI(?)
* Implement native support for Direct3D 12(?)
